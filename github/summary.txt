Git is a revision control system that handles file repositories for software source code. All access is monitored. Changes are tracked. Information about who made changes and why they made them are logged as well. Git benefits distributed and collaborative software development from small projects to enterprise-level systems. Controlled access and having the ability to see changes or to reverse them allows for due diligence and smoother management. For example, a team wants to compare the latest release with last week's release. Git allows for that easily. The team knowing when, why and who made changes allows for comparing the performance of speified versions or fixing bugs that arise or other tasks. Collaboration among team members are enhanced too. A developer can branch off from the master branch and work on a specific portion of the code and then later merge with the group whenever that work is finished, all without missing a beat. Should merging conflicts exist, Git automatically marks them and the team can resolve them accordingly. A revision control sytems is an integral part of software development and Git has certainly made a name for itself as one of the best out there today.
